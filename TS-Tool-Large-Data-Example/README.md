# TS-Tool-Large-Data-Example

This example is meant to show how to load a large dataset from a CSV (Comma Seperated Value) file. It shows some of the options that can be used to configure and customize a Time Series chart when using a big set of data. Note, in this example the data used is specified using **JQuery** and is created from a TSTool command file. Feel free to start with this example as a template and customize the chart to meet the needs of your visualization project.
