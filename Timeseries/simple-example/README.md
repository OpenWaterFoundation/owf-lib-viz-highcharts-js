This example is meant to serve as a base root of how Highcharts works. It shows some of the options that can be used to configure and customize a Time Series chart. Note, in this example the data used is specified within the options (hardcoded). Feel free to start with this example as a template and customize the chart to meet the needs of your visualization project.

## What is a Timeseries Graph

Timeseries, also known as Line Graphs, are used to display quantitative value over a continuous interval or time span. It is most frequently used to show trends and relationships (when grouped with other lines). Line Graphs also help to give a "big picture" over an interval, to see how it has developed over that period.

Line Graphs are drawn by first plotting data points on a Cartesian coordinate grid, then connecting a line between these points. Typically, the y-axis has a quantitative value, while the x-axis has either a category or sequenced scale. Negative values can be displayed below the x-axis.
